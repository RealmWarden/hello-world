# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow

This is an introductory walkthrough, and as such does not need to incorporate any significant information as to my personal nature. Regardless, I have been requested to write about myself. Does it count if the commentary is entirely meta in composition?

## What is Version Control?
- Version control is a practice of **tracking changes** made to code over time and ensuring that the **edits can be integrated** seamlessly into the main project.
- Should work across all workflows and platforms.
- > Long-term chenge history of every file, branching and merging, and traceability
## Source Code Management
- **Tracks modifications** to source code, used to alleviate overhead in communication and management complexity.
- Can **“undo” changes** to database to any commit
- > Commit often, work from latest version, make notes, review changes before committing, use branches, and agree on a workflow
## What is a Git?
- Distributed version control system **widely used** by professional and private developers
- Not based on file names, based on **file content**
- Can work on **other features** while committed ones are tested
